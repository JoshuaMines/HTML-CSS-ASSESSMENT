**How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? **

In it's simplest form the internet is a collection of thousands of computers connected together sending data back and forth.  To facilitate
this like computers are connected via a router creating their own network.  In order to connect all these networks together ISP's (internet 
service providers) use our phone lines to connect multiple networks together, thus giving us the internet.

When you click on a link or a website your computer takes that URL and finds the exact IP address of that site in the DNS.  The browser then 
opens a transmission control protocol and request that information.  The information is then sent back to your computer and properly rendered
on your screen!
